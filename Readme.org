* About

  A small hack to reduce clutter in my init file, but can be potentially used
  elsewhere too. It will hide source code block markers by changing their
  'invisible' text property.

  This is not a package. I don't think it is robust enough and thus not of good
  quality, so I have no plans to submit this as a package to neither Elpa nor
  Melpa. Maybe I will rework it one day, but for now I don't have such plans.

* Installation  

  Either clone this repo or just download 'ob-hide-markers.el'. From there you
  have option to either M-x package-install-file RET ob-hide-markers.el RET or
  just put the file somewhere where Emacs can find it and do appropriate
  autoload or require.

* Usage

  M-x org-babel-hide-markers-mode to turn it on/off.

  There is also an additional command: org-babel-refresh-markers. It can be used
  to hide markers if font-lock has re-drawn markers for some reason, or you
  added new ones etc.

* Issues

 Due to how font-lock mechanism in Emacs works, if fontification is triggered
 after the markers were hidden, the properties will be removed and markers
 revealed. For this to work this mode has to run after the font-lock has done
 it's processing, so it calls font-lock-ensure before it does it's work, which
 might be costly (double-work).
